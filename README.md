## Description

Twitch Timestamp is a Chrome extension that lets you save memorable moments from Twitch streams (both livestreams and VODs). By using the shortcut (`Alt/Option + Shift + N`) or clicking the bookmark icon located at the bottom right of the video player (when hovering over it), you can easily add a personal note about the moment and save it.

## Features

- Bookmark any moment during a live Twitch stream (_if VOD associated to the livestream is available_).
- Add a personal note about the moment you're saving.
- View and manage all saved bookmarks in a clean list.
- Jump to exact moments in VODs (as long they are still available on Twitch).

> **NOTE**: Twitch VODs expire after 14â€“60 days depending on the streamer. Bookmarks linked to expired or deleted VODs may no longer be accessible.

## Installing the Chrome Extension

Since it costs $5 to register my developer account, and I don't feel like spending $5 at the moment (which I'd rather spend on something like a Chipotle bowl), unfortunately it isn't available in the Chrome Web Store at the moment. However, you can install it manually by following these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Go to your browserâ€™s extensions settings (e.g., chrome://extensions in Chrome).
3. Toggle the **Developer mode** switch at the top-right corner to on.
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button.
5. Navigate to the folder where the extension is saved and select it.
6. The extension should now be available for your personal use ðŸ˜Š

## Additional Notes

- You can open the extension's popup using the shortcut: `Alt/Option + Shift + P`
- There's a backend for the extension, so feel free to explore it here: [Twitch Timestamps Backend](https://github.com/YonkoOm/twitch-timestamps-backend)
